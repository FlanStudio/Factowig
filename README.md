# Factowig

**Factowig** is a little project developed by Oriol de Dios (Designer/Artist) and Jonathan Molina-Prados (Programming) for Windows platforms.
It has been designed oriented to be a local multiplayer, sharing the keyboard or multiple controllers (you can play online with some friends using several softwares, for example Parsec).

It has been developed using the game engine Unity3D and integrates some packages like [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/es/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine) and the new Unity's [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/QuickStartGuide.html).


### Controls

#### Keyboard:
* You can move around with WASD.
* Pick up ingredients and wigs from tables, dispensers or the floor with E.
* Throw ingredients (not wigs) using Q.

Note: If both players are sharing the same keyboard then the Player 2 has the arrows, J and K keys as controls.

#### Controller:
* You can move around with the left stick.
* Pick up ingredients and wigs from tables, dispensers or the floor using A (south button).
* Throw ingredients (not wigs) using X (west button).

The main objective is to satisfy the client demands elaborating specific wigs the fastest as possible to gain more money before the time ends.
This game has been thought as a tribute for our loved Overcooked.

Also, do not forget that this is a tutorial level, far away from a finished game.

Hope you like the concept,
